# Sigma.js full-featured demo

This project aims to provide a full-features "real life" application using sigma.js. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [react-sigma-v2](https://github.com/sim51/react-sigma-v2) to interface sigma.js with React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
